    <h4 class="maintext color">
      iT’s TRue! yes, <span>i</span> have been ill, very <span>ill.</span> But why do you say that I have lost control of my mind, why do you say that I am mad? Can you not see that I have full control of my mind? Is it not clear that I am not mad? Indeed, the illness only made my mind, my feelings, my senses stronger, more powerful. My sense of hearing especially became more powerful. I could hear sounds I had never heard before. I heard sounds from <span>heaven;</span> and I heard sounds from hell! <br> <br> Listen! Listen, and I will tell you how it happened. You will see, you will hear how healthy my mind is.

    <h4 class="maintext color">
      So you think that I am <span>MAD?</span> A madman cannot plan. But you should have seen me. During all of that week I was as friendly to the old man as I could be, and warm, and loving.

      No! They heard! I was certain of it. They knew! Now it was they who were playing a game with me. I was suffering more than I could bear, from their smiles, and from that sound. Louder, louder, louder! Suddenly I could bear it no longer. I pointed at the boards and cried, “Yes! Yes, <span>I killed him.</span> Pull up the boards and you shall see! I killed him. But why does his heart not stop beating?! Why does it not stop!?”
